    "## **Resampling Maps and Masks**\n",
    "* 3D medical images are memory intensive and so to reduce computational overhead during training, the data is preprocessed offline as doing it on-the-fly can lead to duplicate memory allocation.\n",
    "* First preprocessing step is to resample maps and masks to a fixed size to make Pytorch batching possible and help model learn efficiently without being biased by size variations. Maps and labels are resampled to (H,W,D) -> (192,192,32) which is maximum of average dimension across all directories, rounded to a multiple of 2^4=16 (total downsampling factor of traditional UNet) to ensure clean downsampling and upsampling (without fractional sizes that require inconsistent padding). For maps resizing is done using Trilinear interpolation because it provides smooth transitions in intensity values preserving the overall structure without introducing artifacts and for mask Nearest Neighbor interpolation is used because it preserves discrete class boundaries, preventing the creation of intermediate invalid label values. For example, 0.5 for a binary mask.\n",
    "We didn't resample to maximum dimension across all directories purely due to memory constraints as otherwise we believe it to be the superior choice and we didn't resample to minimum dimension across all directories as it would lead to too much data loss. Current choice strikes a balance between preserving structural detail and memory efficiency.\n",
    "* In the second step, the resampled (resized) maps' intensities are normalized individually using mean and standard deviation to make the model more robust by mitigating differences in scanners and patient anatomy (along with the first step above).\n",
    "* Lastly, both adc and z_adc maps are concatenated (stacked on top of each other) to make a 2-channel input (C,H,W,D) -> (2,192,192,32) for UNet to allow the model to leverage information from both modalities."
