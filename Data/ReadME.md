# **Note**
* Due to GitHub's upload constraints (size limit and number of files restriction), raw data files and preprocessed files aren't uploaded here!
* However, the dataset used here is publically accessible at the resource shared at the end of repo's main page.
* Downloading and extracting the data from the source and adjusting the paths accordingly in the "Preprocessing.ipynb" would allow straightforward reproducibility of the preprocessed maps and labels.
